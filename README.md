It is used to play WAV files (games and apps) from a MicroSD card through an audio cable into where the tape deck would normally plugin thus eliminating the need for a 30-year-old tape deck. Its a play only function so no record feature. You can still record using conventional methods though. Simply find your favourite game or app and convert it to WAV (22khz/Mono/8bit)  file format, copy it to the sd card and the rest is straight forward. It is based on the firmware I developed with the same name. The firmware is opensource so you could make one of these devices yourself.
