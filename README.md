It is used to play WAV files (games and apps) from a MicroSD card through an audio cable into where the tape deck would normally plugin thus eliminating the need for a 30-year-old tape deck. Its a play only function so no record feature. You can still record using conventional methods though. Simply find your favourite game or app and convert it to WAV (22khz/Mono/8bit)  file format, copy it to the sd card and the rest is straight forward. It is based on the firmware I developed with the same name. The firmware is opensource so you could make one of these devices yourself. 

When purchasing a microSD card do not get a cheap or a super-fast one like a class 10 card.  Operating it is simple. Once the SD is in with wavs in the root of the SD card use the up and down buttons to scroll through the wav files. Press play to play and again to pause. If you press the stop button while there is no file playing it will change the volume for you. The M button enables motorcontrol if you need it. The the reset button resets the device.
